# README

Various templates, images, and useful scripts for LaTeX.

## Templates

In [templates](templates) there are/will be templates for articles, posters, etc.

## Images

In [images](images) there are various logos for use in talks / posters.
Copyright for the various logos belongs to the respective universities / organisations.

## Scripts

In [scripts](scripts) there is a useful script for checking for bibtex entries with missing DOIs. I generally use it to update the bibtex between writing the preprint and submitting to a journal, or when updating the arXiv version after acceptance.
